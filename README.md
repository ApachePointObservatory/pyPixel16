# pyPixel16

This is a collection of functions that perform bit- and bitewise operations of byte strings of unsigned shorts (16-bits on most systems). It performs the operations using Numpy. This package will replace the [pixel16](https://github.com/ApachePointObservatory/pixel16.git) wrapper (author unknown).

1. ```uflip```: flips the sign bits in a string of unsigned short ints.
2. ```byteswap```: swaps bytes in a string of unsigned short ints.
